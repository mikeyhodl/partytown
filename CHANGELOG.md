# @qwik.dev/partytown

## 0.14.3

### Patch Changes

- ✨ automatically execute partytown scripts added to the page after initialization, e.g. on client-side route transitions, without needing to dispatch a `ptupdate` event (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#746](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/746))

- 🐞🩹 load cross-origin iframes natively when their content can't be fetched, so widgets like the reCAPTCHA badge work instead of crashing with a NetworkError (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#749](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/749))

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- 🧹 remove the unused dotenv dependency, the package has zero runtime dependencies again (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#742](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/742))

- ✨ `fallbackTimeout: 0` disables the main thread fallback entirely (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#741](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/741))

- 🐞🩹 don't throw when the snippet runs in an iframe with a cross-origin top, run Partytown in the iframe itself instead (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#735](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/735))

- 🐞🩹 support `document.createRange().createContextualFragment()` and `document.fonts` (load/check/ready) in the worker (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#731](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/731))

- 🐞🩹 the main thread fallback now loads external scripts through their `src`, previously only inline content was copied (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#739](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/739))

- 🐞🩹 keep forwarded globals (e.g. dataLayer) local to the worker instead of sync-proxying them to the main thread, forward items already pushed before Partytown loads, and stop dropping forwarded events when the worker global doesn't exist yet (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#721](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/721))

- 🐞🩹 don't crash initialization when a Proxy global (e.g. vinxi's `MANIFEST`) returns unclonable objects during the window snapshot (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#737](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/737))

- 🐞🩹 run `navigator.sendBeacon` and iframe `contentWindow.fetch` urls through `resolveUrl`, so analytics requests like GA4's `/g/collect` can be proxied (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#740](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/740))

- 🐞🩹 allocate the atomics SharedArrayBuffer small and grow it on demand instead of eagerly reserving 1GB, which newer Chrome versions can refuse (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#729](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/729))

- 🐞🩹 add a noindex robots meta to the sandbox html so crawlers stop reporting 404s for it in Search Console (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#738](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/738))

- 🐞🩹 stop rewriting `this` inside string literals, template literal text and comments when preparing scripts for the worker (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#730](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/730))

- 🐞🩹 serialize underscore-prefixed object members for the worker (e.g. `wp.i18n.__`), excluding only partytown internals (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#736](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/736))

- 🐞🩹 only treat digit property names as window frame indexes, so globals like `Infinity` resolve correctly in the worker (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#732](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/732))

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 🐞🩹 don't throw when a script assigns an invalid value to `a.href`, e.g. `http://` (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#725](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/725))

- 🐞🩹 allow `resolveUrl` to return a `Readonly<URL>` (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#726](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/726))

- 🐞🩹 match `<script>` tags case-insensitively when rewriting iframe srcdoc HTML, so `<SCRIPT>` variants can't bypass the rewrite (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#724](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/724))

- 🐞🩹 wrap the snippet in an IIFE so top-level helpers no longer leak `t`, `e`, `n` into the page's global scope and break other classic scripts (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#727](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/727))

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- ✨ add `logForwardedEvents` config flag to enable debug logging for forwarded events and triggers (by [@mws19901118](https://github.com/mws19901118) in [#704](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/704))

### Patch Changes

- 🐞🩹 initialise ErrorObject to Error instead of null to prevent instanceof crash (by [@gioboa](https://github.com/gioboa) in [#714](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/714))

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 🐞🩹 update repository metadata to QwikDev/partytown and bump Node to 24.x for OIDC trusted publishing (by [@thejackshelton](https://github.com/thejackshelton) in [`1b34fe1`](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/commit/1b34fe191539926d21a87affe55a6e2dc5d15765))

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix Lighthouse deprecated API warnings by skipping Chrome Privacy Sandbox properties (SharedStorage, AttributionReporting) during window introspection (by [@AlexJohnSadowski](https://github.com/AlexJohnSadowski) in [#697](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/697))

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- ✨ add new documentation for Drupal integration (by [@OulipianSummer](https://github.com/OulipianSummer) in [#701](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/701))

  This commit adds a new section to the integrations section of the documentation, detailing how to install, configure, and use the Drupal integration for PartyTown.

### Patch Changes

- patch: expand docs on manual Drupal module installation, fix typos (by [@OulipianSummer](https://github.com/OulipianSummer) in [#703](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/703))

  Although uncommon, some Drupal web sites do install all of their third-party modules without composer. In these cases, it is still possible to use the contributed PartyTown module to manage PartyTown from a GUI, though the setup does require some extra explanation. I've added some notes on this uncommon setup in the hope it will be helpful to those users.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `strictProxyHas` configuration option for accurate namespace conflict detection (by [@chadgauth](https://github.com/chadgauth) in [#692](https://github.com/QwikDev/partytown/pull/692))

  **Summary:**

  This release adds a new configuration option `strictProxyHas` that enables accurate property existence checks using the `in` operator. This is required for scripts like FullStory that check for namespace conflicts when loaded via Google Tag Manager (GTM).

  **Key Changes:**

  - Add `strictProxyHas?: boolean` config option to enable accurate `in` operator behavior
  - Update window proxy's `has` trap to use `Reflect.has()` when `strictProxyHas: true`
  - Default is `false` for backwards compatibility
  - Add FullStory GTM integration test with production-ready snippet
  - Document the configuration and provide usage guide

  **Usage:**

  ```html
  <script>
    partytown = {
      forward: ['FS.identify', 'FS.event'],
      strictProxyHas: true, // Enable for FullStory via GTM
    };
  </script>
  ```

  **Backwards Compatibility:**

  This is a non-breaking change. The default behavior remains unchanged (`strictProxyHas: false`), so existing implementations will continue to work without modifications.
